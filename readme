I have written and run my code on google colab. 
I have only tested the code on that service so I cannot guarantee that it works on a different platform.

The notebook I created can be run on colab simply by running all cells in order. 
The code requires that you connect to huggingface hub, to do this you will need to fill in two variables:
username: appears in cell 3 and is your huggingface hub username
key: appears in cell 3 and is an API access key which can be generated on huggingface hub. It should allow write access.

An alternative would be to not push the model to the hub. This would mean altering the trainer code. 

The first cell installs all the requirements for the code.
However, I have also included a requirements.txt file in case someone would wish to run the code on a different set-up.

It would then need to run as a jupyter notebook (I have included this as dependency in requirements.txt)
However, this is untested so I cannot guarantee that it will work.
